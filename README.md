# n-SAC-ComputerVision-Project
Validation of n-Sphere Anti-Falsing Calculation (n-SAC) for overcoming shadows in computer vision


Introduction
The Geometry-Based Anti-Falsing for Computer Vision project is a cutting-edge initiative that addresses one of the most pressing challenges in modern automated systems: improving the reliability and robustness of computer vision (CV) systems in complex environments. Automated systems, such as self-driving cars, heavily rely on CV to interpret and analyze their surroundings. However, environmental factors such as shadows, reflections, and atmospheric conditions like humidity significantly hinder the performance of CV algorithms. These factors can introduce false positives and negatives, potentially leading to critical errors in real-world applications.
This project aims to overcome these challenges by leveraging the innovative n-Sphere Anti-Falsing Calculation (n-SAC) method. The n-SAC technique focuses on geometric principles to mitigate the impact of shadows and lighting inconsistencies, providing a computationally efficient and adaptable solution. The ultimate goal is to validate the n-SAC method’s effectiveness in real-world scenarios by using video data from moving platforms under varying conditions. Through this project, the team seeks to enhance the accuracy and reliability of CV systems, contributing to the broader goal of advancing autonomous technologies and supporting critical applications in security and defense.

Problem Statement and Goals:
The Automated systems relying on CV often face inaccuracies due to shadows and environmental factors, especially in real-time, 2D and 3D spaces. This project aims to validate the n-SAC method as a solution to these issues. The specific goals include:
•	Testing the n-SAC method for recognizing known objects, such as buildings, in video data.
•	Evaluating its robustness under varying lighting and environmental conditions.
•	Developing a working prototype that demonstrates the application of n-SAC.
